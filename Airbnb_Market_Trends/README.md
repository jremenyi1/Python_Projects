# Exploring Airbnb Market Trends
## Background Information
New York City has a variety of Airbnb listings to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, with several different price levels, room types, and locations.


## Data
There are three raw data files in the data folder:
- airbnb_price.csv
- airbnb_room_type.xlsx
- airbnb_last_review.tsv.

## Aim
My focus area is to investigate the short-term rental market in New York. My analysis provide insights on private rooms to the real estate company.
- What are the dates of the earliest and most recent reviews? Store these values as two separate variables with your preferred names.
- How many of the listings are private rooms? Save this into any variable.
- What is the average listing price? Round to the nearest two decimal places and save into a variable.
- Combine the new variables into one DataFrame called review_dates with four columns in the following order: first_reviewed, last_reviewed, nb_private_rooms, and avg_price. The DataFrame should only contain one row of values.
