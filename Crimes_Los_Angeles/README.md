# Analyzing Crime in Los Angeles

## Backround
Los Angeles, California, attracts people from all over the world, offering lots of opportunities, not always of the good kind!

## Data
- crimes.csv

## Aim
I explored the crimes.csv dataset and focused on answering the following questions:
- Which hour has the highest frequency of crimes? Store as an integer variable called peak_crime_hour.
- Which area has the largest frequency of night crimes (crimes committed between 10pm and 3:59am)? Save as a string variable called peak_night_crime_location.
- Identify the number of crimes committed against victims of different age groups. Save as a pandas Series called victim_ages, with age group labels "0-17", "18-25", "26-34", "35-44", "45-54", "55-64", and "65+" as the index and the frequency of crimes as the values.
