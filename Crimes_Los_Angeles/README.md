# Analyzing Crime in Los Angeles

## Backround Information
Los Angeles, California, attracts people from all over the world, offering lots of opportunities, not always of the good kind! It is highly populated city, and it is not always glamorous and there can be a large volume of crime.

## Data
- crimes.csv

## Aim
I explored the crimes.csv dataset and focused on answering the following questions:
- Which hour has the highest frequency of crimes? Store as an integer variable called peak_crime_hour.
- Which area has the largest frequency of night crimes (crimes committed between 10pm and 3:59am)? Save as a string variable called peak_night_crime_location.
- Identify the number of crimes committed against victims of different age groups. Save as a pandas Series called victim_ages, with age group labels "0-17", "18-25", "26-34", "35-44", "45-54", "55-64", and "65+" as the index and the frequency of crimes as the values.
