# Hypothesis Testing with Men's and Women's Soccer Matches

## Background Information
Time to begin applying your statistical testing skills to historical data of men's and women's international soccer matches!
You'll work at a major online sports media company specializing in soccer analysis and reporting. You will test the hypothesis to determine if women's international soccer matches result in more goals scored than men's.

## Data
- men_results.csv
- women_results.csv

## Aims
- Perform an appropriate hypothesis test to determine the p-value, and hence result, of whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis that the mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's. Use a 10% significance level.
   - For this analysis, you'll use Official FIFA World Cup matches since 2002-01-01, and you'll also assume that each match is fully independent, i.e., team form is ignored.
   - The p-value and the result of the test must be stored in a dictionary called result_dict in the form: result_dict = {"p_val": p_val, "result": result}, where p_val is the p-value and result is either the string "fail to reject" or "reject", depending on the result of the test.
